I recently found out about the rare Visual Snow syndrome and became immediately interested in it.

While researching online, I noticed many people reported that watching a video of a static (e.g. TV static) temporarily "freezes" their visual snow symptoms and gives them a sensation of relief. [This is the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=800f9UNiF4Y) generally shared. Under the video, you can read thousands of comments confirming its effectiveness.

The static video could be able to stimulate the areas of the brain that cause visual snow and trigger a response. Several organisations are researching the effects of these images on the brain of people affected by VS, however, research is still limited and we need to stay tuned to get a definitive answer.

Interestingly, some people have documented how watching these images for prolonged sessions has improved their VS symptoms (see [here](https://mvertigo.org/t/how-i-cured-my-palinopsia/15781)). However, sitting in front of a screen for hours staring at a static video is not fun, and it requires time. But what if you could get the potential benefits of the static while carrying out your daily activities on your computer?

Users started experimenting and created static noise overlays, although these all had problems of compatibility or large size (see [\#1](https://www.reddit.com/r/visualsnow/comments/jlwpae/working_on_a_program_that_overlays_your_screen/), [\#2](https://www.reddit.com/r/visualsnow/comments/jzgjs0/improved_foss_visual_snow_screen_overlay_for_vs/), [\#3](https://www.reddit.com/r/ItalyInformatica/comments/jrprun/fare_due_soldi_e_aiutare_chi_soffre_di_visualsnow/) for more). Needless to say, this theory got me so interested that I decided to use my knowledge to create an open-source, cross-platform Visual Snow Relief Overlay that works on Windows, Mac, and Linux. The overlay sits on your screen and lets you interact with anything underneath it, so you can e.g. keep browsing while you use it. You can set the opacity and choose from several static noise textures, so you can experiment which gives the best result.

The project can be found at [https://github.com/belvederef/visual-snow-relief-overlay/](https://github.com/belvederef/visual-snow-relief-overlay/). If you want to give it a go, head to the “download” section and get the right version for your system.

We can contribute to the research! I need all the feedback you can give to document the effects of the app and improve it, as well as understanding if it actually provides benefits to people affected by VS, in the long run. If this is effective, I will get in touch with the right research organisations and show our findings.

If you feel like contributing to the code, open a Github issue and help me improve this project.

\*\*TL;DR\*\*

I created an open-source, cross-platform Visual Snow Relief Overlay that works on Windows, Mac, and Linux that might help improve the symptoms of VS. You can find the project and the download at [https://github.com/belvederef/visual-snow-relief-overlay/](https://github.com/belvederef/visual-snow-relief-overlay/).

Share feedback on its effects so that we can contribute to the research together.

Edit: since many of you are asking for it, I am including a link for [donations](https://ko-fi.com/belvederef). Any contribution will help improving the app and doing research, and is much appreciated. Also, giving feedback on the app's effectiveness will help make progress, so please do!
