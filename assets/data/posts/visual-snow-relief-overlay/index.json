Under the video, you can read thousands of comments confirming its effectiveness.</p>\n<p>Several organisations, among which is the <a href=\"https://visualsnowproject.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Visual Snow Initiative</a>, are researching the effects of static images on people affected by Visual Snow. However, research is still limited and we need to stay tuned to get a definitive answer.</p>\n<p>Some people have documented how watching these images for prolonged sessions has improved their VS symptoms (see <a href=\"https://mvertigo.org/t/how-i-cured-my-palinopsia/15781\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">forum post</a>). However, sitting in front of a screen for hours staring at a static video is not fun, and it requires time. But what if you could get the potential benefits of the static while carrying out your daily activities on your computer?</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-idea\">The Idea</h2>\n<p>Users started experimenting and created static noise overlays, although these all had problems of compatibility, difficulty of use, or large size (see <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/visualsnow/comments/jlwpae/working_on_a_program_that_overlays_your_screen/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">#1</a> and <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/visualsnow/comments/jzgjs0/improved_foss_visual_snow_screen_overlay_for_vs/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">#2</a> for more).</p>\n<p>At this point, I decided to get involved and to use my skills to help the community, since the solution seemed extremely close. All that was needed was to implement the idea and gather feedback.</p>\n<p>As a result, I created <strong>Visual Snow Relief Overlay</strong>, an open-source, cross-platform app that works on Windows, Mac, and Linux. The overlay sits on your screen and lets you interact with anything underneath it, so you can e.g. keep browsing while you use it. You can set the opacity and choose from several static noise textures, so you can experiment which gives the best result.</p>\n<p>The project can be found at <a href=\"https://github.com/belvederef/visual-snow-relief-overlay/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https://github.com/belvederef/visual-snow-relief-overlay/</a>. If you want to give it a go, head to the \"download\" section and get the right version for your system.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/vQPtwxU.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Here is a screenshot</a> of one of the filter types in action.</p>\n<h3 id=\"update\">Update</h3>\n<p>Visual Snow Relief Overlay goes mobile! Read the <a href=\"/blog/posts/android-visual-snow-relief-overlay/\">full article</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-response\">The Response</h2>\n<p>Since the <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/visualsnow/comments/l22xta/i_created_an_opensource_vs_relief_overlay_app/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">original post</a> made on the Reddit, I have received overwhelming feedback. Many affirm that using the overlay helps them focus when reading, and reduces eye strain and migraine symptoms!</p>\n<p>The idea seems to be working amazingly, and I am planning to release a mobile version soon.</p>\n<h2 id=\"contribute\">Contribute</h2>\n<p>We can all contribute to the research! I need all the feedback you can give to document the effects of the app and improve it, as well as understanding if it provides benefits in the long run.</p>\n<p>Moreover, I set up a link for <a href=\"https://ko-fi.com/belvederef\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">donations</a>. As any project, anything I create incurs some costs, that I am mostly covering on my own. Any contribution sustains my work and allows me to improve and develop more tools for the Visual Snow community.</p>\n<p>You can also:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Join the <a href=\"https://visualsnowproject.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Visual Snow Initiative Project</a>, which is researching the use of static images to treat Visual Snow.
